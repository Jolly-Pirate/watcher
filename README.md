Script for Steem Witnesses to watch witness for missed blocks, failover towards backup-nodes & alert via multiple services.

- Multiple alert options available (TELEGRAM, SMS <NEXMO, TWILIO>, EMAIL)

## Manual Installation

However, you can also run node manually, with PM2 or your favourite program.

#### Requirement: Node >= 8
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y curl software-properties-common gnupg build-essential libssl-dev
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
sudo npm i npm@latest -g
```

#### 1.) Clone Repository and install packages
```
git clone https://github.com/witness-essentials/watcher.git
cd watcher
npm i # or yarn
```

#### 2.) Edit your Config
```
cp configs/config.example.json configs/config.json
nano configs/config.json
```

#### Config Explanation

- TEST_MODE: It will alert you in case of missed blocks, but without actually changing signing keys
- MISSED_BLOCKS_THRESHOLD: How many blocks can be missed until signing key gets changed / or disabled.
- ROTATE_KEYS: The script can rotate between your signing keys, until ROTATE_ROUNDS has been reached (-1 is infinite)
- WITNESS: Witness account
- ACTIVE_KEY: Add your private active key. Only needed if you're not adding private signing keys (see below) or if your witness is disabled.
- SIGNING_KEYS: Add **all** your signing keys here as pairs. As of HF20, you can now also change keys and witness properties via your private signing keys.

```
 [{ "public": "STM7..", "private": "5JS.." }, { "public": "STM5..", "private": "5PD.." }, { .. }]
```

  - NEXMO: Use NEXMO as SMS alert service
  - TWILIO: USE TWILIO as SMS alert service

You can either run it directly with `npm start` or by using PM2 (my favourite).

pm2 start npm --name=watcher -- start
pm2 save
pm2 logs watcher
```

You can also test, if everything has been setup correctly, by running the test script
